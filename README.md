**********GAMES 35**********
Rule:
Example: Initially, person A chose 2, so S = 0 + 2 = 2.
Next person B can only choose 1, 3, 4, 5 (cannot choose 2), for example, choose 4, so S = 2 + 4 = 6.
Next, A can only choose 1, 2, 3, 5 (choose 2 again but not 4), for example, choose 5. So S=6+5=11.
Next, B can only choose 1, 2, 3, 4 (not 5 because A has just chosen 5), for example, choose 2. So S = 11 + 2 = 13â€¦.
Whoever makes the sum of S greater than 35 loses.
Suggestions:
Whoever reaches 28, the other loses
If you want to do that, the computer has to go to 22 first
